Here you can see several advantages of planning your affairs using my website:

- Thanks to planning, you build your day the way you need it. You have time to work, play sports, cook, there is time for some hobby.
- Planning does not allow you to sit idle. After all, when you wake up in the morning, you already know what things are waiting for you, and you have to do it all in time.
- Those people who started planning very quickly were able to appreciate the advantages of this approach to the allocation of personal time.

## Instalation
In order to create such a website, I used Django a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
To run Django program, first install the required packages and modules . To install the package, you need to follow this command:

bash
$ pip install Django
$ django-admin startproject
$ python manage.py migrate
$ cd C:\Django 
$ cd todo
todo> python manage.py runserver
